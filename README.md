## The Project

### Proposal

I propose that I create a fully featured chatbot interface for Casper's website. This app is a demonstration of what that experience would be like for the end user.

### Target audiences

This app is for the Casper Sleep marketing and engineering team.

### Goals

- Show Casper Sleep Inc. the benefits of having a robust chatbot interface

### Requirements

- A chat interface with a chatbot that can answer any question that is referenced in [Casper's FAQ](https://casper.com/ca/en/faqs)

### Design considerations

- I chose to use [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com/) because I I have also read through most of [Google's Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/) and I agree with a lot of their opinions on User Experience.

## Contributions

### Style guides

- [UI Namespaces](https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/#javascript-namespaces-js-)
